Go to Find Action -> plugins -> installed. if installed shows dart and flutter then continue to next step, else go to Find Action -> plugins -> marketplace and search for flutter and add the plugin. If prompted to install dart plugin as well, accept. Otherwise search for dart plugin and install that as well. 
3. Clone the repository and open the 'home_insurance_app'/'sdk' directory from android studio not the root directory
4. Go to settings -> flutter and add the path to flutter SDK if not already present.
